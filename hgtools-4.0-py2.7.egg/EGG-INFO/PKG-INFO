Description: hgtools
        =======
        
        hgtools builds on the setuptools_hg plugin for setuptools. hgtools
        provides classes for inspecting and working with repositories in the
        Mercurial version control system.
        
        hgtools provides a plugin for setuptools that enables setuptools to find
        files under the Mercurial version control system.
        
        The classes provided by hgtools are designed to work natively with the
        Mercurial Python libraries (in process) or fall back to using the
        command-line program ``hg(1)`` if available. The command-line support is
        especially useful inside virtualenvs
        that don't have access to a system-wide installed Mercurial lib (i.e. when
        the virtualenv was created with ``--no-site-packages``).
        
        .. note:: The setuptools feature
        
          You can read about the setuptools plugin provided by hgtools in the
          `setuptools documentation`_. It basically returns a list of files that are
          under Mercurial version control when running the ``setup`` function, e.g. if
          you create a source and binary distribution. It's a simple yet effective way
          of not having to define package data (non-Python files) manually in MANIFEST
          templates (``MANIFEST.in``).
        
        .. _setuptools documentation: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#adding-support-for-other-revision-control-systems
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        Here's a simple example of a setup.py that uses hgtools::
        
            from setuptools import setup, find_packages
            setup(
                name="HelloWorld",
                version="0.1",
                packages=find_packages(),
                setup_requires=["hgtools"],
            )
        
        If you run the setup.py above, setuptools will automatically download
        hgtools to the directory where the setup.py is located at (and won't
        install it anywhere else) to get all package data files from the
        Mercurial repository.
        
        You should not need to, and I recommend you don't, install hgtools in
        your site-packages directory. Let setuptools grab it on demand. Also,
        try not to specify an upper bound for the requirement. Usually, simply
        specifying 'hgtools' will get the latest version, which is likely to
        remain compatible (as a plugin) for the life of the project. Specifying
        an upper bound (i.e. `hgtools<1.1`) will only prevent you from getting
        bug fixes. Only specify an upper bound if you require support for older
        versions of Python.
        
        Auto Version Numbering
        **********************
        
        With the 0.4 release, hgtools adds support for automatically generating
        project version numbers from the mercurial repository in which the
        project is developed.
        
        To use this feature, your project must follow the following assumptions:
        
        	 - Mercurial tags are used to indicate released versions.
        	 - Tag names are specified as the version only (i.e. 0.1 and not
        	   v0.1 or release-0.1)
        	 - Released versions currently must conform to the StrictVersion in
        	   distutils. Any tags that don't match this scheme will be ignored.
        	   Future releases may relax this restriction.
        
        Thereafter, you may use the HGToolsManager.get_current_version to
        determine the version of your product. If the current revision is tagged
        with a valid version, that version will be used. Otherwise, the tags in
        the repo will be searched, the latest release will be found, and hgtools
        will infer the upcoming release version.
        
        For example, if the repo contains the tags 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 and the
        repo is not on any of those tags, get_current_version will return
        '0.3.1dev' and get_current_version(increment='0.1') will return
        '0.4dev'.
        
        A distutils hook has been created to hack setuptools to use this version
        information automatically. To use this functionality, just use the
        ``use_hg_version`` parameter to setup.
        For example::
        
            from setuptools import setup, find_packages
            setup(
                name="HelloWorld",
                use_hg_version=True,
                packages=find_packages(),
                setup_requires=["hgtools"],
            )
        
        If the value supplied to use_hg_version resolves to True, hgtools will
        use the mercurial version to determine the version of the
        package (based on get_current_version). If an sdist is created, hgtools
        will store the calculated version in the tag_build of the setup.cfg and
        will use that version when deploying remotely. Therefore, if you are
        using auto-versioning, you should not use setuptools tags explicitly.
        
        See the jaraco.util setup.py for an example of this technique.
        
        Versioning Parameters
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It's also possible to pass keyword parameters to use_hg_version to
        tweak how it generates version numbers. To pass parameters, instead of
        setting `use_hg_version = True`, set it to a non-empty dictionary with
        one or more of the following parameters:
        
         - `increment`:
           A string indicating the default version increment for the project.
           By default, this value is '0.1', meaning hgtools will use the version
           '1.1dev' for builds following the 1.0 release and '1.10dev' for builds
           following a 1.9.3 release. Set this value to '1.0' or '0.0.1' for the
           current tree to help hgtools guess the target version.
        
         - `version_handler`:
           A Python function with the following signature::
        
               def calc_version(mgr, options):
                   return str('1.0')
        
           hgtools will use this function instead of its default implementation
           to customize the version number calculation. The `mgr` object is the
           `hgtools.managers.HGRepoManager` object referencing the local repo
           and the `options` is the dictionary passed to use_hg_version.
        
           Use this option, for example, to include the mercurial hash or local
           revision ID in the version::
        
               def id_as_version(mgr, options):
                   "Always return the mercurial revision ID as the version"
                   id_n = mgr._run_cmd([mgr.exe, 'id', '-n']).strip()
                   return id_n
        
               setup(
                   #...
                   use_hg_version={'version_handler': id_as_version},
               )
        
           The first thing to note is the mgr does not yet provide a nice
           interface for getting anything but the tags for a revision, so the
           example digs into the underlying API to extract the ID. hgtools should
           provide better support in the HGRepoManager classes in future releases.
        
           Use this feature with caution. If you have not already read the
           `setuptools documentation on specifying a project version
           <http://packages.python.org/distribute/setuptools.html#specifying-your-project-s-version>`_,
           the author recommends you do read that.
        
        
        Changes
        *******
        
        4.0
        ~~~
        
        * Removed functions in hgtools (package) module deprecated since 0.6.6.
        
        3.0.2
        ~~~~~
        
        * Restored Python 2.6 compatibility in reentry module.
        
        3.0.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Merged changes from 2.2.2 to address #13.
        
        3.0
        ~~~
        
        * Removed support for Python 2.5. Python 2.6 or later is now required.
        
        2.2.3
        ~~~~~
        
        * Restored Python 2.5 compatibility in some modules.
        
        2.2.2
        ~~~~~
        
        * Removed the LibraryManager from the default imports. This means it will not
          be available unless the client application specifically imports
          `hgtools.managers.library`. This change appears to fix #13.
        
        2.2.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Added some exception handling and tests around Library Manager in the hopes
          of preventing #13.
        
        2.2
        ~~~
        
        * LibraryManager has been re-written to use the command-line API in-process.
          The new LibraryManager now only works Python 2.7 and greater, but also now
          shares the same capability as the SubprocessManager with full tags support.
        
        2.1
        ~~~
        
        * hgtools now builds natively on Python 3, rather than requiring a 2to3
          conversion at install time.
        
        2.0.3
        ~~~~~
        
         * Issue #12: Suppress exceptions besides ImportError when importing
           Mercurial modules.
        
        2.0.2
        ~~~~~
        
        * Force `hg log` and `hg parents` to use the defaults style for output.
          Otherwise, the parsing code fails to identify the tags. Also, reset the
          'default.log' value in case a user has an alias for `hg log` in his .hgrc.
          (For example, some use log=-G to force the graph output). Thanks to
          `dc <https://bitbucket.org/dc>`_ for the patch.
        
        2.0.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fixed issue #10 where hgtools would not parse setup.cfg properly if
          the Python 3 configparser backport was installed on Python 2.
        
        2.0
        ~~~
        
        * Refactored HGRepoManager to better support multiple tags:
        
          - `.get_tag` replaced by `.get_tags`, which returns a set of tags
            for a specific revision. This is currently a set because mercurial
            does not retain any meaningful order of the tags.
          - `.get_tags` replaced by `.get_repo_tags`.
          - `.get_parent_tag` replaced by `.get_parent_tags`.
          - added `.get_parents` which returns the revision(s) of the specified
            revision.
        
        * Removed support for older versions of mercurial (LegacyLibraryManager).
        * The subprocess manager is now the default. The HGTOOLS_FORCE_CMD variable
          no longer has any effect on hgtools.
        * Version detection now resolves multiple tags on the same revision by
          choosing the greatest version.
        
        1.2.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fix issue #9 - The repo managers and thus the setuptools plugin will no
          longer find files that aren't in the location specified. The
          LibraryManagers already will throw an error in this case, but now the
          SubprocessManager does what's best and only returns files relative
          to the location.
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        * Implemented the `version_handler` version parameter. Fixes #5.
        * If multiple tags are given for a revision, the last tag is used instead
          of the first.
        
        1.1.6
        ~~~~~
        
        * More aggressively construct a the environment when running `hg` in a
          subprocess. Fixes another manifestation of #7. Thanks whit537.
        
        1.1.5
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fix issue #8 - Re-wrote SubprocessManager.get_tag to extract the tag using
          `hg tags` for more reliable tag resolution.
        
        1.1.3
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fix issue #7 - SubprocessManager now passes explicit environment to child
          process.
        
        1.1.2
        ~~~~~
        
        * Restored Python 2.5 compatibility.
        
        1.1
        ~~~
        
        * Added support for subrepos. The setuptools plugin will now traverse
          subrepos when finding files.
        
        1.0.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fix issue #6 where the force_hg_version flag was affecting installation
          of tagged packages not employing hgtools.
        
        1.0
        ~~~
        
        * Python 3 support
        * Now supports revisions with multiple tags (chooses the first, which
          appears to be the latest).
        * Removed support for deprecated use_hg_version_increment.
        * Added HGRepoManager.existing_only to filter managers for only those
          which refer to an existing repo.
        * Employed HGRepoManager.existing_only in plugins. Fixes #2.
        * SubprocessManager no longer writes to /dev/null. Fixes #3.
        
        0.6.7
        ~~~~~
        
        * Auto-versioning will no longer use the parent tag if the working
          copy has modifications.
        
        0.6.6
        ~~~~~
        
        * Some minor refactoring - moved functions out of top-level `hgtools`
          module into hgtools.plugins.
        
        0.6.5
        ~~~~~
         * Test case and fix for error in SubprocessManager when 'hg'
           executable doesn't exist.
        
        0.6.4
        ~~~~~
         * Fix for NameError created in 0.6.3.
        
        0.6.3
        ~~~~~
         * Deprecated use_hg_version_increment setup parameter in favor of
           parameters to use_hg_version.
        
        0.6.2
        ~~~~~
         * From drakonen: hgtools will now utilize the parent changeset tag
           for repositories that were just tagged (no need to update to that
           tag to release).
        
        0.6.1
        ~~~~~
         * Fixed issue #4: Tag-based autoversioning fails if hgrc defaults
           used for hg identify
        
        0.6
        ~~~
         * Refactored modules. Created ``managers``, ``versioning``, and
           ``py25compat`` modules.
        
        0.5.2
        ~~~~~
         * Yet another fix for #1. It appears that simply not activating the
           function is not sufficient. It may be activated by previously-
           installed packages, so it needs to be robust for non-hgtools
           packages.
        
        0.5.1
        ~~~~~
         * Fix for issue #1 - version_calc_plugin is activated for projects that
           never called for it.
         * LibraryManagers no longer raise errors during the import step
           (instead, they just report as being invalid).
         * SubprocessManager now raises a RuntimeError if the executed command
           does not complete with a success code.
        
        0.5
        ~~~
         * Fixed issue in file_finder_plugin where searching for an
           appropriate manager would fail if mercurial was not installed in
           the Python instance (ImportErrors weren't trapped properly).
        
        0.4.9
        ~~~~~
         * Fixed issue where version calculation would fail if tags contained
           spaces.
        
        0.4.8
        ~~~~~
         * Auto versioning now provides a reasonable default when no version
           tags are yet present.
        
        0.4.3-0.4.7
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
         * Fixes for versions handling of hgtools itself.
        
        0.4.2
        ~~~~~
         * Fixed formatting errors in documentation.
        
        0.4.1
        ~~~~~
        
         * Reformatted package layout so that other modules can be included.
         * Restored missing namedtuple_backport (provides Python 2.5 support).
        
        0.4
        ~~~
        
         * First release supporting automatic versioning using mercurial tags.
